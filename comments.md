As I said in class, this app is not a proof of concept nor a prototype, it has to work well for the final version. If you say it contains the list of all restaurants, then the must be. Find an API to retrieve restaurants. Same thing with recommendation, find an AI API that does that for you. 

If this app is just a proof of concept, you cannot expect higher than a C grade.
